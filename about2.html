    <p>The mission of Rhodes Architectural Stone is to delight our customers and realize their architectural dreams in exquisite antique and newly crafted natural stone. Founded by master mason and principal entrepreneur Richard Rhodes, the company and its products are informed by Rhodes' formal apprenticeship in Siena, Italy, and 20 years of experience in stone art, quarrying, installation and fabrication. RAS focuses on large, multi-year projects, where highest quality, craftsmanship and design vision are required.</p>
	<p>From its headquarters in Seattle, RAS manages a global stone production team using state-of-the-art communications.

  <h3 class="clear" id="what">What We Do</h3>
      <p>Rhodes Architectural Stone is dedicated to helping our customers realize their architectural dreams in exquisite, newly hand-crafted and antique natural stone. With an extensive history of work in stone design, fabrication, and installation, we showcase the highest and best use of stone and focus on projects that require creative vision, striking design, and master craftsmanship. Natural stone solutions provided by Rhodes Architectural Stone incorporate the finest granites, limestones, and sandstones available in the world. Employing techniques and tools in the tradition of renaissance Europe, we create hand-crafted finishes for our renowned collection of newly quarried materials. We also offer antique materials with unique patinas, colors, and textures from centuries of wear. By reclaiming these materials, we are able to preserve part of the world's patrimony that would otherwise be lost due to urbanization of rural areas and large-scale public works projects.</p>

    <p>From idea to reality, every project large or small is supported by our full set of services. RAS sales consultants meet with customers to discuss design ideas. We listen, understand your needs, and collaborate in project development, drawing upon our database of over 35,000 images of installed and in situ stonework. For each customer, we create a confidential website to facilitate communication of digital images and design dialogue to move projects from development to execution in a timely manner. </p>
	<p><strong>Mockups and Stone Selection</strong><br />
Mockups play an important role early on to test designs and make stone decisions. We quickly produce mockups to help our customers visualize final stone scale, material, and finish. Images of mockups are posted to the website for client review and approval. If appropriate, we ship approved mockups to project sites to serve as an installation guide.</p>
	<p><strong>Value Engineering and Contracting</strong><br />
We work with design teams to value engineer stone applications to ensure that customers get the most for their money. The contract between the customer and RAS delineates precise quantities and specifications. A fifty-percent deposit finalizes the order. Then, RAS designers provide shop drawings to specify fabrication dimension, finish, and tolerance for every face of every piece of stone.</p>
	<p><strong>Production and Delivery</strong><br />
Stone selection determines country of fabrication. Our global stone production team trains and certifies our nearly two dozen contract factories to produce stone exactly as specified for each project. The team also performs rigorous quality inspections throughout the fabrication process. When appropriate, complex assemblies are pre-assembled and images are posted to the customer website for review and approval. We manage crating, customs clearances, and handling logistics to ship the order from country of origin directly to your job site. Production and transportation progress are continuously monitored to keep our customers abreast of order status.</p>
