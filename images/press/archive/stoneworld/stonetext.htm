      </b>The Tilted Stone Courtyard faces the Jemez Mountains, and rests on a plane that slopes downward towards the Shadow House’s “passage,” which spans the length of the residence and is flanked by various rooms. According to Architect Antoine Predock, the sloped courtyard allows the sound of water rushing over it to “charge the living spaces” -- specifically the living and diinng rooms that frame it.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For the project, Predock chose Antique Salmon granite, which he explained, “once formed the roads and alleys of medieval villages of South China. It was salvaged from the Three Rivers Gorge Dam project, [and] shows character from centuries of human and animal traffic, tannins of indigenous vegetation and minerals in the ground water; all contributing to its natural patina.”<br>
      <br>
      The use of natural elements for a project plays a critical role for Predock, and they are represented in the Shadow House. The foyer of the residence contains an earth floor, reminiscent of “the early settlers’ earth floors,” and a concrete fireplace houses “the element of fire” and represents a “counterpoint to the earth and water.”<br>
      <br>
      Predock describes the Shadow House, where the Tilted Stone Court resides, as “a journey through the desert, bridging sunrise and sunset, water and fire, earth and sky.”&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Predock notes that “some surfaces have texture marks, [and] in other instances, wear has removed texture, leaving the upward face smooth, polished by centuries of foot traffic.”<br>
