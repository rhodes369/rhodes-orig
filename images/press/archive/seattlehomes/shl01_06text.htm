						<p align="left">THE PREMISE? CELEBRATING THE BEST OF SEATTLE DESIGN. The problem? Limiting the list to a mere 100. In compiling it, we pondered a multitude of deserving nominees, quickly coming to the realization that there is much to celebrate about this city. There’s a wealth of creativity-in myriad froms-throughout this Northwest gem we call home.<br>
							<br>
						<p align="left">In perusing our 100 picks, you’ll discover some old friends and some new finds.. You’ll undoubtedly agree with many of our choices, but invariably, not all. Which further proves that this list could have gone on indefinitely. In the end, though, we were looking for finalists that define Seattle design in some way. They’re influential. They’re cutting edge. They’re distinctly Northwest in style. For one reason or another, they’re noteworthy in this area. <br>
							<br>
						</p>
						<p align="left">As you read the following pages, keep one thing firmly in mind: We haven’t attached rankings to our picks. There are what we at SH&amp;L consider to be the top 100 people, places and things. That is, #100 on our list is just as important as #1. Meanwhile, we’re already keeping an eye out for candidates suitable for our next list. Who, what, where will they be? -<font size="1">HEATHER J. PAPER </font></p>

								Antique and reclaimed stone comes from distant settings such as China, India, and Indonesia, where “modernity” is rapidly replacing old roads, riverbeds and buildings. Rhodes Architectural Stone imports this rich, raw material, bringing the past’s unique patina to today’s residential environments and to public projects such as The Wave, a stunning sculptural installation at the Tacoma Art Museum. With two decades of experience in stone art, founding partner and CEO Richard Rhodes has built his company into a world class source for handcrafted stonework shaped with the same tools and techniques used for centuries. -<font size="1">DEBRA PRINZING</font></p>
