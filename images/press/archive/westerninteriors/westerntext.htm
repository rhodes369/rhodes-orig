      </b>For the living room, the designer selected clean-lined, untufted pieces of furniture upholstered in silk and mohair blends to contrast with the fireplace, which was fashioned from Chinese Granite. “There’s a Seattle company that’s salvaging this granite and limestone and bringing it to America,” says Fuller, “and the patinas are just incredible. We made the fire surround from a door threshold that had been stepped over for generations.” The stone for both the fireplace and the powder-room sink was rescued from a village that will soon be flooded and obliterated when the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River is completed
